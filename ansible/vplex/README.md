# Ansible Automation Examples for Dell EMC Storage Platforms
This repository contains Ansible automation code samples for storage platforms provided by TME, SA, and other Dell EMC internal teams.  The examples highlight the capabilities of the modules and their ability to be integrated into more complex playbooks, workflows, and applications.


This folder contains examples for configuring a VPLEX system.  
There are basic playbooks which show the currently configured resources via the gather facts module.  There are also more advanced examples of using playbooks with roles in conjunction with the PowerMax or PowerStore modules to create a backend storage volume and a virtual volume from it.


## Support
The examples are provided as is with no warranties.  Some basic knowledge of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and additional technology integration is expected.  Please enter an [issue](https://github.com/dell/ansible-storage-automation/issues) if you would like to report a defect.
