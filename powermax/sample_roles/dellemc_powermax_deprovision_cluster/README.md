Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - name: Storage deprovisioning
      hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      gather_facts: no

      vars:
        - vars/deprovision_variables.yml
        - vars/credentials.yml
        - vars/connection.yml



      tasks:
        - name: Create MV using host
          include_role:
            name: dellemc_powermax_deprovision_cluster
